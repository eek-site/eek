            <div class="benefit-card">
                <h4><span class="checkmark">✓</span> Professional Technical Assessment</h4>
                <p>We don't just send an invoice. We provide a comprehensive technical report that documents every
                    aspect of the incident, damage assessment, and repair necessity — written in the professional
                    language insurance assessors expect.</p>

                    reports explicitly confirm that all damage is consistent with the reported event and rule out any
                    pre-existing conditions.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Damage progression timeline showing exponential cost escalation</li>
                    <li>Comparative cost analysis (immediate vs. delayed response)</li>

                <h4><span class="checkmark">✓</span> Cost Validation & Reasonableness</h4>
                <p>We demonstrate that all charges are fair and reasonable by verifying:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parts pricing against manufacturer OEM specifications</li>
                    <li>Labor times against manufacturer workshop manual standards</li>

            <h2>Industry-Standard Reporting</h2>
            <p>Our insurance reports are prepared according to <strong>NZIFDA (New Zealand Independent Fuel Distributors
                    Association)</strong> professional standards for fuel contamination incident assessment and
                remediation.</p>

            <h3>What This Means for You</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Faster Claim Approval:</strong> Professional reports answer assessor questions before
                    they're asked, eliminating delays</li>
                <li><strong>Higher Approval Rates:</strong> Comprehensive technical documentation removes barriers to
                    claim approval</li>
                <li><strong>Full Reimbursement:</strong> Detailed cost justification supports approval at the full
                    claimed amount</li>
                <li><strong>Less Stress:</strong> We handle all documentation and communication with your insurer</li>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Our Professional Assessment Process</h2>

            <h3>1. Incident Verification & Documentation</h3>
            <p>We thoroughly document the incident including date, time, location, circumstances, and contamination
                details. Our reports explicitly confirm damage consistency with the reported event.</p>

            <h3>2. Comprehensive Damage Assessment</h3>
            <p>Every affected component is inspected and tested. We provide objective evidence of damage through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fuel system pressure testing</li>
                <li>Injector spray pattern analysis</li>
                <li>Electronic resistance testing</li>
                <li>Visual contamination inspection</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Technical Repair Justification</h3>
            <p>For each component, we explain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What failed:</strong> Specific component and failure mechanism</li>
                <li><strong>Why it failed:</strong> Technical explanation (e.g., lubrication loss, metal-to-metal wear)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Test results:</strong> Objective measurements showing failure</li>
                <li><strong>Why replacement is necessary:</strong> Manufacturer protocols and industry standards</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Cost Justification & Validation</h3>
            <p>We demonstrate cost reasonableness through three independent methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Necessity:</strong> Objective test failures prove component replacement required</li>
                <li><strong>Savings:</strong> Comparative analysis shows costs prevented by immediate action</li>
                <li><strong>Standards:</strong> Manufacturer and industry protocols require the work performed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Quality Assurance & Roadworthiness</h3>
            <p>Post-repair testing confirms all systems are functioning correctly and your vehicle is safe to drive.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Example: Petrol in Diesel Incident</h2>
            <p>Here's how our professional reporting prevents claim issues:</p>

            <div class="benefit-card">
                <h4>Damage Progression Timeline</h4>
                <p><strong>Immediate Extraction (0-30 seconds):</strong> $400-$800 (extraction only)<br>
                    <strong>Brief Operation (30-120 seconds):</strong> $1,500-$3,500 (pump + injectors likely)<br>
                    <strong>Extended Operation (2-5 minutes):</strong> $5,000-$15,000+ (complete system failure,
                    potential total loss)
                </p>
                <p><strong>Our Service:</strong> Immediate extraction performed — $800 cost, $4,200-$14,200 damage
                    prevented</p>
            </div>

            <div class="benefit-card">
                <h4>Technical Component Justification</h4>
                <p><strong>Fuel Pump Replacement - $1,200</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Why it failed:</strong> Diesel fuel provides essential lubrication to pump internals. Petrol
                    contamination acts as a solvent, stripping lubrication and causing metal-to-metal contact,
                    generating debris and pump seizure.</p>
                <p><strong>Test evidence:</strong> Fuel pressure test: 850 kPa (specification: 1,800-2,000 kPa) — FAILED
                    (58% below minimum)</p>
                <p><strong>Why replacement required:</strong> Internal mechanical damage from metal-to-metal contact
                    cannot be reversed through cleaning. Manufacturer service protocol requires replacement following
                    contamination exposure with engine operation.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>Do I need to contact my insurance company first?</h3>
            <p>No. We can provide emergency service immediately and prepare the insurance documentation afterward.
                However, it's good practice to notify your insurer as soon as possible after the incident.</p>

            <h3>Will my insurance cover the full cost?</h3>
            <p>While we cannot guarantee insurance coverage (as this depends on your policy), our professional reporting
                maximizes your chances of full claim approval by providing comprehensive technical justification for all
                work performed.</p>

            <h3>How long does the insurance claim process take?</h3>
            <p>With our professional documentation, many claims are approved within 5-10 business days. We eliminate the
                typical back-and-forth delays by answering all assessor questions upfront.</p>

            <h3>What if my insurance company has questions?</h3>
            <p>We're happy to communicate directly with your insurance assessor to clarify any technical details or
                provide additional information.</p>

            <h3>Do you charge extra for insurance reporting?</h3>
            <p>No. Professional insurance documentation is included as part of our standard service. We believe in
                transparent, comprehensive reporting for all customers.</p>

            <h3>What if I don't have insurance?</h3>
