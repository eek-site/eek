            <div class="subsection">
                <p><strong>2.1 Pathways to Supplier Status:</strong> A Supplier becomes a participating member of the Eek Mechanical contractor network by either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>completing the supplier registration form at https://www.eek.nz/supplier; or</li>
                    <li>accepting any job or work order issued by Eek Mechanical, regardless of whether the formal registration process has been completed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>2.2 Acceptance of Terms:</strong> By taking either of the actions described in Clause 2.1, the Supplier confirms their acceptance of all terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, including any referenced policies or schedules. Acceptance of a job constitutes contractual agreement.</p>
                <p><strong>2.3 Network Participation and Public Representation:</strong> Suppliers acknowledge and agree that they are part of the Eek Mechanical network of mechanics and contractors—a global network delivering roadside assistance and related services on behalf of the Company. Eek Mechanical may publicly represent the Supplier's participation in this network in all customer communications, including but not limited to booking confirmations, progress updates, and marketing references. The Supplier consents to being identified by name, region, and trade classification for operational and commercial purposes.</p>
                <p><strong>2.4 Privacy Waiver and Data Disclosure:</strong> The Supplier grants Eek Mechanical a standing waiver to disclose necessary business and contact information to customers for the purpose of delivering services. This includes, but is not limited to, business name, dispatch contact number, service credentials, vehicle registration, technician name, and estimated arrival times. This waiver is granted under applicable data protection laws and remains in effect for the duration of the Supplier's participation in the network.</p>
                <p><strong>2.5 Voluntary Withdrawal from the Network:</strong> To exit the Eek Mechanical network, the Supplier must submit a formal request via the withdrawal form at https://www.eek.nz/supplier-relations. The request must clearly and explicitly state the intent to withdraw from the network. Informal notices, lack of responsiveness, or failure to use the prescribed form will not be accepted as valid withdrawal. Upon confirmation, the Supplier will be removed from the active supplier database and no longer receive job offers.</p>
                <p><strong>2.6 Documentation Requirements:</strong> Suppliers must provide all required documentation, including certifications, insurance, and evidence of compliance with applicable legal and environmental standards, as directed by the Company.</p>
                <p><strong>2.7 Approval and Onboarding:</strong> All applications and documents submitted will be reviewed by Eek Mechanical's procurement team. Once approved, the Supplier will receive an onboarding package outlining purchase order protocols, invoicing procedures, and communication standards.</p>
                <p><strong>2.8 Ongoing Compliance:</strong> Suppliers must comply with Eek Mechanical's Supplier Code of Conduct and maintain continuous adherence to all Company policies, safety expectations, and legal requirements.</p>
                <p><strong>2.9 Payment Contingency:</strong> No payment for services rendered shall be processed unless the Supplier has completed the registration process and provided all required documentation. Eek Mechanical reserves the right to withhold payment for unregistered or non-compliant suppliers.</p>

If the amount collected from the customer is $850 or less, the Supplier shall not be entitled to any payment from Eek Mechanical for that transaction, and the provisions of Clause 7.4 shall apply to any amount the Supplier claims remains owing. The Supplier acknowledges and agrees that Eek Mechanical is not obligated to pay any amount unless and until customer payment exceeds $850.</p>
                <p><strong>7.4 Unpaid Customer Debts:</strong> Any remaining unpaid debts from customers of Eek Mechanical, after applying the provisions of Clause 7.3, shall be assigned to the Supplier for collection.

Set-off may be applied without prior notice and the Company's calculation shall be conclusive absent manifest error.</p>
                <p><strong>7.6 Payment Authority:</strong> The Supplier acknowledges and agrees that full authority over the timing and terms of payments is ceded to Eek Mechanical.

                <p><strong>9.1 Confidentiality Obligations:</strong> The Supplier agrees to keep all information, whether oral, written, or electronic, related to Eek Mechanical confidential. This includes, but is not limited to, operational, financial, strategic, and customer-related data.</p>
                <p><strong>9.2 Restriction on Financial Disclosures:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>9.2.1 The Supplier shall not disclose, discuss, or share any information about the financial terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to what the Company pays the Supplier, with the Company's customers, other suppliers, or any third parties.</li>

                    <li>9.4.1 Any disclosure of information that Eek Mechanical determines, at its sole discretion, to be confidential, including violations of Clause 9.2, will constitute a material breach of this Agreement. The Supplier acknowledges that the determination of confidentiality rests entirely with the Company, and no correspondence or dispute regarding the classification of such information will be entered into. The Company reserves the right to take immediate legal or contractual action, including termination of this Agreement and pursuit of damages, as a result of any breach of confidentiality.</li>
                    <li>9.4.2 In the event of such a breach, the Supplier shall forfeit any amounts currently outstanding and owed to them by the Company as a penalty. This penalty will apply without prejudice to any other remedies available to the Company, including termination of the Agreement and/or legal action.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>9.5 Liability for Disclosure-Induced Non-Payment:</strong> If a Supplier's disclosure of financial information to a customer, or any communication by the Supplier that causes or contributes to a customer disputing, withholding, reducing, or refusing payment to Eek Mechanical, the Supplier shall be liable to the Company for the full amount invoiced to that customer. This liability arises immediately upon customer non-payment or underpayment and is in addition to (not in substitution for) any other remedies under this Agreement including forfeiture under Clause 9.4. The Supplier agrees that: (a) the Company's invoice amount to the customer represents the measure of damages; (b) this sum is a genuine pre-estimate of the Company's loss; (c) the Company need not prove that the Supplier's disclosure was the sole cause, only that it was a contributing factor; (d) the Supplier waives any right to dispute the quantum of damages under this clause.</p>
                <p><strong>9.6 Survival:</strong> The confidentiality obligations under this Clause 9 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement indefinitely.</p>
